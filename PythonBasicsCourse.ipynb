    "Python is a high level programing language. It is an interpreter language that promotes a simple and concise programming style.\n",
    "In comparison to other popular programing languages (C++, Java, C#, Fortran, C) it is quite easy to pick up and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why python and where can i use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's greatest advantage lies in the enormous amount of already built in libraries that can be used by everyone.\n",
    "This makes Python very versitile in terms of applications.\n",
    "Python can be used for a large variety of tasks from automating excel, Data analysis, Data visualisation, Web Development, Machine Learning etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snakes, spiders and planets!?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda** is **not** a **programing language** but a package that contains python in combination with multiple python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Keras..) . It also contains few different integrated development environments (IDE's) that can be used for programing. The IDE (Spyder, Jupyter, VS, PyCharm, Sublime etc.) choice is always up to personal preference of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the aim of this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this tutorial is to provide basics of python programing syntax and functionality. Hopefully this tutorial should provide enough \"equipment\" in terms of knowledge for one to be able to understand and implement multiple modules and libraies by themselves.\n",

    "   - **python syntax**: ```int```\n",
    "  2. **STRING**\n",
    "   - Anything embedd in the quotations (can be both double or single quotations). **example:** ```'OMV', \"1492\", '25/5', \"Hello World\", \"§$%&$&\" etc...```\n",
    "   - **python syntax**: ```str```\n",
    "  3. **BOOLEAN**\n",
    "   - logical statements True & False. **example:** ```True, False```\n",
    "   - **python syntax**: ```bool```\n",
    "  4. **FLOAT**\n",
    "   - Any decimal number. **example:** ```3.41, 6.9999999, -8.321321321 etc...```\n",

    "### ***Functions*** ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to mathematics, functions in python take an input and return an output. The difference between functions in mathematics \n",
    "and programing is that functions in programing don't necessary require and input and don't have to give an output.\n",
    "Functions are mainly used when there is a repetitive task, that will occur several times.\n",

    "#### Defining the function\n",

In the closed brackets after the function name we define function **parameters**(in the example ```l``` and ```w```. Parameters are the \"input\" of the function. We end the function definition with a colon ```:```.\n",
    "Any operation that we want our function to do must be **indented**. ```return``` keyword returns the output for of the given task, or operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling the function\n",
